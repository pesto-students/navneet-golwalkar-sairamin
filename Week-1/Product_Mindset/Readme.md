# Collaboard app helps institutes run classrooms by having a virtual whiteboard using a web browser or mobile app.
It allows teachers to collab online with their students in real-time.

Collaboard app allows its users to use a whiteboard online without the need of having a specific physical device. It can be run using a web browser or mobile app. Institutes can use it to establish a collaboration between their teachers and student. Teachers can present their points/notes on this virtual whiteboard and at the same time, they can allow students to point out where they have doubts using a laser tool. 

Using a physical whiteboard in online classrooms, teachers may find some issues.

- If there is no more space on the board to move further on the topic, the teacher has to clean up the board. As result, no notes could be saved.
- There might be some cases where students can’t see the notes properly. They might be blurry or not at a proper distance. 
- The teacher may not able/ready to start the camera.
- Creating clean diagrams might be tedious. 

Collaboard is an online app, which first of all doesn't need the camera to be opened. which seems to be the major issue with the physical whiteboard. 

- They can save their notes which can be later shared with the students.
- It has a variety of tools, which allow teachers to make notes cleanly, they can draw clean diagrams with the provided shapes. 
- They can add images to make the notes more engaging. 
- They can highlight the key points with a highlighter tool. 
- They can allow students to point out the area on the whiteboard, where they have doubts.

“It was very tedious for me to recall the points I had taught in my previous classes,” said Rahul Vaidya teacher in Pesto. “To make sure I don’t miss out on the key points, I have to rewrite it in my notebook. With Collaboard I don't need to do anything extra, it gets saved right after I start typing, it saves me a lot of time.”
